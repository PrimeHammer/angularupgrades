          <p class="has-top-padding">Angular is the future of AngularJS apps. In addition to future-proofing your app, migrating from AngularJS to Angular has many advantages. Despite the benefits, migrating apps is lots of work. Our professional team handles the entire migration process. From AngularJS to Angular, we got you covered.</p>

          <h3 class="title is-3 has-top-padding">Why Upgrade to Angular?</h3>
          <p>Migrating from AngularJS to Angular is inevitable. Every line of AngularJS you write today is a technical debt for tomorrow. With no providers, factories, services, directives with special attributes, digest cycle or watchers; Angular is much easier to reason about. Services, components and that’s it!</p>

          <h3 class="title is-3 has-top-padding">AngularJS to Angular. We Get You There</h3>
          <p>Great Angular app development is what we do. Our developers live and breathe AngularJS and Angular. When you work with our expert developers you don’t have to worry about the upgrade process. That is our job.</p>

          <h3 class="title is-3 has-top-padding">Benefits of Upgrading</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Faster prototyping and scaffolding with AngularCLI</li>
            <li>Happy developers who won’t leave because of technical debt</li>
            <li>Less error-prone, thanks to TypeScript</li>
            <li>Better test coverage</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p class="has-top-padding">Angular 2 runs much faster on mobile environments. The base code has been stripped of unnecessary features. Everything from view caching to template precompilation and reuse is aimed at reducing the pressure on memory and the VM.</p>

          <p class="has-top-padding content is-medium"><i><center>In the long-run you get happier developers and shorter development cycles.</center></i></p>

          <h3 class="title is-3 has-top-padding">Why AngularJS is a Bad Choice</h3>
          <p><b>A Steep Learning Curve</b> <br>As it introduces some strange programming concepts such as providers and the digest cycle, AngularJS has a steep learning curve that adds unnecessary complexity to your projects.</p>
          <br>
          <p><b>Increasing Technical Debt</b> <br>Sooner or later, your AngularJS apps will have to be upgraded to Angular. The sooner you start doing it, the better for your project in terms of cost and quality.</p>
          <br>
          <p><b>Hard to Find Good Developers</b> <br>Developer tend to shy away from obsolete technologies. As time goes by, finding good AngularJS developers will only get harder.</p>
